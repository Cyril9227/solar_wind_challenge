# Solar Wind Challenge

Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) result from magnetic instabilities occurring in the Sun atmosphere, and interact with the planetary environment and may result in intense internal activity such as strong particle acceleration, so-called geomagnetic storms and geomagnetic induced currents. These effects have serious consequences regarding space and ground technologies and understanding them is part of the so-called space weather discipline.

ICMEs signatures as measured by in-situ spacecraft come as patterns in time series of the magnetic field, the particle density, bulk velocity, temperature etc. 

The goal of this project is to detect Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) in the data measured by in-situ spacecraft.
